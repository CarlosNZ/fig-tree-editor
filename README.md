**json-edit-react** is a simple, yet highly-customisable, React component for editing or viewing JSON
 data in the browser. Features include:

 - Edit individual values, or whole objects as JSON text
 - Fine-grained control over which elements can be edited, deleted, or added to
 - Customisable UI, through simple, pre-defined [themes](#theme-link), or fine-grained CSS overrides
 - self-contained -- constructed with HTML/CSS, so no dependance on external UI libraries
